# Getting Started

The Structix package is available under **[releases](https://github.com/wiindsom/Structix/releases)** on the github page.

## Pre-Requisite

Structix started as a simple side project something I didn’t expect to go far with. If you're unfamiliar with any of the data structures showcased here, or if you're not sure how they work or what they’re for, I recommend taking a moment to research them online. A solid understanding of their general behavior and use cases will help you get the most out of this library.
If you're still with me, great. I’ll do my best to explain each structure and how it functions within Structix → **[Dive Into The Concepts](concepts)**
