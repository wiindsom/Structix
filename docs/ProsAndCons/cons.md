- **🐢Slight Overhead** <br/>
*Wrapper functions add some performance and memory cost compared to raw tables, though negligible in most cases.*
- **📘Learning Curve** <br/>
*Beginners unfamiliar with data structures like trees or dequeues might need some time to understand and when to use them.*
- **🚫Unnecessary Structures** <br/>
*Most of these data structures you'll find unnecessary in development because it needs to have a very specific usecase. Roblox games typically only need structures like arrays, dictionaries to function.*
- **🔄Manual Replication** <br/>
*Structix data is local to memory, meaning you'll need to handle syncing between client/server manually if needed.*
- **🪶Not Always Relevant** <br/>
*For very small, temporary, or throwaway data sets, plain roblox tables might be simpler and faster to use.*
