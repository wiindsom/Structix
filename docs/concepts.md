# Concepts

The functionality and concept behind Binary Trees, Collections, Deques, Heaps, Linked Lists, Maps, Priority Queues, Queues, Sets, and Stacks.

---

## Binary Tree

A Binary Tree branches like a decision tree. Each node has two children: left and right. When ordered, it becomes a Binary Search Tree, which makes lookups fast. Trees model hierarchies, expressions, file systems, and even spatial zones in games. <br/> **[Learn More About Binary Trees](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/binary-tree)**

## Collection

A Collection is a flexible, ordered group of items like a dynamic array. It gives you tools to manipulate, iterate, and transform values in bulk. Think of it as a friendly workspace for general-purpose list processing, filtering, and reshaping data. <br/> **[Learn More About Collections](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/collection-interface)**

---

## Deque

A Deque (also known as a Double Ended Queue) gives you control at both ends. You can add or remove items from the front or back. It’s flexible and ideal when you need both stack and queue behaviors think of it as a two-way street for data flow. <br/> **[Learn More About Deques](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/deque)**

---

## Heap

A Heap keeps the most important item (according to your rules) at the top. In a min-heap, the smallest item rises. In a max-heap, the largest does. Heaps power efficient priority management like job schedulers and pathfinding. <br/> **[Learn More About Heaps](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-data-structure)**

---

## Linked List

A LinkedList connects data like a chain. Each piece points to the next (and sometimes the previous). It’s not fast for random access but excels at efficient insertions and deletions especially in the middle. Use it when flexibility beats speed. <br/> **[Learn More About Linked Lists](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/linked-list)**

---

## Map

A Map (or dictionary) links keys to values. You use a key to retrieve its paired value. It’s ideal for storing associations like a username mapped to a score, or an item ID mapped to its description. Maps are essential for fast lookups. <br/> **[Learn More About Maps](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/map)**

---

## Priority Queue

A PriorityQueue is like a line where some people are allowed to cut in front based on urgency. Each element has a priority. The queue always serves the most critical item first. It's a higher-level abstraction built on a heap, perfect for game events, task queues, or AI decision systems. <br/> **[Learn More About Priority Queues](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/priority-queue)**

---

## Queue

A Queue is a line of people waiting their turn. It follows First-In, First-Out (FIFO). The first element in is the first to be removed. Queues are perfect for scheduling, turn-based logic, and managing sequences where order matters. <br/> **[Learn More About Queues](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/queue)**

---

## Set

A Set is a collection of unique items. No duplicates allowed. It’s great for checking membership, enforcing uniqueness, and doing operations like unions, intersections, and differences just like in mathematics. <br/> **[Learn More About Sets](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/set)**

---

## Stack

A Stack is like a stack of plates: the last one you put on is the first one you take off. It follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. Use it when you need to undo actions, backtrack, or manage nested operations like call stacks in programming or game state rewinds. <br/> **[Learn More About Stacks](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/stack)**
